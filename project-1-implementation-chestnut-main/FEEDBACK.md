# COMMENTS

* Overall very good.
* Some stuff could be made to look a bit nicer.

# NOTES FROM 1:1

* Jeremy thought he could take off of some extra points but all requirements were indeed met.

## Implementation notes

* Credentials should not be in repositories. Use environment varilables or config files or something, but don't check credentials in to source control!
* Subreddits that are collected should not really be hard coded either.

# GRADE
