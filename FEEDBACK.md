* Could have used latex tables for figure 2
* no r/politics stuff

# NOTES FROM 1:1

* some of the plots because there are multiple points on the the same x-axis value there's a lot of crossed lines
  * may need to sort x axis by date column?
* lots of good analysis, more figures than waas required
